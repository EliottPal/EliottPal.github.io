Epitech project, 3rd year.  
The **Epicture** project consists in the creation of a mobile application.  
This application is an Imgur client so itâ€™s built using the Imgur API (Imgur is a platform similar to Reddit used to share any kind of pictures).  
The application is composed of multiple pages implementing different functionalities:
- Profile page: user informations & posts uploaded by the user.
- Upload page: take picture using gallery or camera & upload it to Imgur.
- Browse page: see all the latest viral posts on Imgur, use the search bar to look for specific posts.
- Favortites page: see all your favorites posts.
