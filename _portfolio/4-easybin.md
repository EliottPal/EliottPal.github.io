### Details: 
Personal project.  

**Easybin** is a mobile app aimed to facilitate the selective sorting of everyday products.

It uses a simple scanning system (similar to Yuka) that gives you all the required information about the chosen product.  

The databse provides a basic set of items and every user can register new items to the database, that can later be scanned by other users.
